The standard deviation $ \sigma_x $ of a data set is

$ \sigma_x = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{n = 1}^{k}(x_n - \bar{x})^2}{n}}$,

where $ \bar{x} $ is the mean of the data set $ x_i $, k is the number of elements in the data set, and $ \sum $ denotes the sum of all the differences of each element from the mean squared.
